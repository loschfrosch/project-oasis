This is the final exercise for the EPFL Extension School Course 50 Things You Need to Know About the Internet.

### Setup

This html website has been build with the help of bootstrap, the frontend framework has been discussed in the course and I was curious to use it.

### Content

The Website consists of four pages and two subpages - roughly as planned in a [sketch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkNzy-b-lrrX-hesqvckFq6GxJRRHcg6/view?usp=sharing).

**Home** - index.html

**Actors** - actors.html - an overview of different organizations
* Actors profile - actors-profile.html a detailled view of one organziation
* Actors form - actors-form.html a form for a new entry

**About** - about.html - description of the project

**Play** - play.html - contains a quiz for gaining points


### Questions

After initial rounds of developing the site, a few points remain open to resolve
* how can a form be embed responsive? height on mobile phones of actors-form.html is not full
* how to make the footer sticky on all pages? on actors-profile.html it reamains in the middle

### Acknowledgments

This page was developed with the help of stackoverflow.com, getbootstrap.com, w3schools.com, codepen.io, startbootstrap.com, youtube videos and various blog posts.
